Microservices Project with .NET
Welcome to the Microservices Project! This project is designed using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Clean Architecture principles with ASP.NET Core Identity for secure authentication and authorization. This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and links to relevant Microsoft documentation.

üöÄ Overview
